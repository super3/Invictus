						<h3>What is BitShares AGS?</h3>					
						<p style="text-align: justify;">								
              The Internet has spawned a new era that is transforming our society like never before.  Simultaneously giving us 
              new freedoms and exposing us to previously inconceivable levels of surveillance and control.  Invictus Innovations is
              leading the way toward a more free society through the development of new technologies that enable the decentralization
              of everything from banking to voting.

              We are committed to building technologies that are so decentralized that they are beyond our control once developed.  Building
              these technologies requires significant funding and gives us no direct sources of revenue.  Undeterred from our mission to
              develop freedom-giving technologies, we have created an opportunity for those who would like to donate to the cause: BitShares AGS. 
					  </p>

						<h3>How will my donations be used?</h3>	
					  <p style="text-align: justify;">								
              Invictus Innovations is committed to using every resource at our disposal to secure the life, liberty and property for
              all of mankind.  We will use all donations in a manner that we feel will best achieve these objectives and we will maintain
              a public transaction ledger that outlines how we are allocating the funds given to us. That said, these are no-strings-attached
              donations and should not be construed to place any legal obligation on Invictus Innovations to provide anything in return
              for these donations.  

              You should only donate if you believe we are a good cause and you trust us to use the funds wisely.  
            </p>
						<h3>Take part in BitShares Solutions</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">								
							Both BitShares PTS and BitShares AGS rely upon the willingness of us and Allied developers to honor these donations
							with credits in new decentralized block-chain based products that we as Invictus Innovations and others develop.  All
              of our products are open source and therefore anyone is able to honor the donators who made these technologies possible.
              
              From Allied developers we expect a Social Consensus to form in the marketplace about
							what constitutes honorable developer behavior. BitShares PTS and BitShares AGS constitute concrete 
							documentation of what benefits developers received from those who laid the industry foundation.  

							Credits in individual blockchains are a concrete way for developers to acknowledge and reciprocate those benefits.
							How the market responds to these new products, will depend upon how well that product is perceived to have honored 
							the emerging Social Consensus.
							</p>

						<h3>Social Consensus</h3>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
							We see a consensus beginning to form around the following principles: 
							(a) Developers should seek a reasonable balance between equal-opportunity lotteries and ways to compensate
							those who sacrifice their savings or labor. (b) The market needs to give developers freedom to raise 
							funds to develop, support and promote their new DACs.  We believe that the following allocation represents
							the minimum fair genesis-block allocation for block-chain based solutions.
							</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>At least 10% of the bitshares should be allocated to holders of BitShares PTS.</li>
							<li>At least 10% of the bitshares should be allocated to holders of BitShares AGS.</li>
							<li>The remaining bitshares should be customized to the needs of each BitShares chain.</li>
							</ul>
              <br/>
              This emerging social consensus and resulting network effect will be further reinforced by the Social Consensus Software License
              which will require all derivative software products to initialize their blockchain according to this consensus.  
              <br/>

               <p style="text-align: justify;">								
                 Beginning New Yearâ€™s Day 2014, there will be 10,000 new AGS available in a new patron competition, every day, for 200 days. 
                 5,000 of them will be available to BitShares PTS holders. 5,000 of them will be available to Bitcoin holders. 
                 That's ultimately 2,000,000 total shares, just like BitShares PTS.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Those who donate bitcoins to this Angel Address will proportionally split 5,000 AGS:
               </p>

               <p>
                 Those who donate PTS to this angel Address will proportionally split 5,000 AGS

               <br/>
                 Every day the shares are divided among those who donated that day.  Donations are being tracked by two independent sites:
