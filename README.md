Invictus 

========

Static web files for the Invictus [website bounty](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1742.0). <br/>
Current repo status available here: [http://invictus.io](http://invictus.io)


## Requirements and Specs - [Full Details](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1742.0)

### Static Content - [See Issue](https://github.com/super3/Invictus/issues/1)
 Static Content or Basic PHP to manage headers/footers/language translation is preferred to systems dependent upon databases.  The site should load quickly and the content should be easily updated and versioned with github.  To test/deploy the site should be as simple as a git pull into the document root of a PHP enabled server.

### Multiple Language Support - [See Issue (~$800 Bounty)](https://github.com/super3/Invictus/issues/2)
Chinese + English minimum, but the more languages supported the better.

### Charts - [See Issue (~$800 Bounty)](https://github.com/super3/Invictus/issues/3)
Stock Charts and price quotes may be the only dynamic content

### Creative Freedom
Everything is up for change including logos for all products and the company itself.  We like the Invictus Horse, but do not want to put constraints on the creativity of the market.
